1. Compare with analytical solutions - such as Brans Dicke
2. Predictions of observables - dilation distance D_V (measure with BAO), with galaxy surveys - you need H and angular diameter distance, growth rate - f\sigma_8 - you actually need f*sigma_8 (z=0)*D (growth factor)
3. MCMC analysis for real data - BAO data (background), RSD- fsigma8, CMB (likelihoods from literature), PPN, LIGO (use emcee - package in python)
4. Phil - see if we need cosmosis - generates likelihood
5. Fisher forecasts for growth rate, lensing, Not now(lensing power spectrum - P_(Phi + Psi))
